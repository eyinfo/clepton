#### Clepton
Clepton is a framework to simplify the development of microservices. It can be imported via maven or gradle to implement the necessary features of microservices (interceptors, authentication, aop, reclaim/cache/cluster policy, service scheduling) with simple configuration. At the same time, the WebX layer also provides rich data response formats for microservice RESTFull Api development.
